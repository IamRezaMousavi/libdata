## Features

üöÄ **High Performance Optimization**

- **Blazing fast speed** using modern, optimized algorithms
- **Low memory footprint** with intelligent dynamic memory management

üì¶ **Lightweight & Dependency-Free**

- **Extremely small size** (ideal for embedded systems and space-sensitive applications)
- **Static linking support** - no need to install the library on target systems
- **Zero external dependencies** - works out of the box

üëå **Easy to Use & Flexible**

- **Clean, readable implementation** with thorough documentation
- **Simple integration** with two options:
  - **Library Mode** for large projects
  - **Header-only Mode** for quick integration in small projects

üß™ **Reliable & Stable**

- **Comprehensive unit tests** ensuring correctness
- **Ready-to-use examples** in [`examples/`](examples/) for quick start

### Why Choose libdata?

‚úî **The optimal choice** for projects prioritizing **speed, memory efficiency and small size**  
‚úî **No installation headaches** across different systems (thanks to static linking)  
‚úî **Clean modular code** that's easy to maintain and extend  

## Getting Started

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

### Installation

#### Library Mode

1. Build the library:

    ```bash
    cmake -Bbuild -H.
    cd build/
    make
    ```

2. Install the library:

    ```bash
    sudo make install
    ```

3. Use header files in your code:

    ```c
    #include <libdata/datastruct/queue.h>
    ```

4. Build your binary with this command:

    ```bash
    gcc program.c -ldata
    ```

#### Header-only Mode

1. Copy the `*.h` and `*.c` files you need.
2. Paste them alongside your header and source files.
3. Include the header files in your code:

    ```c
    #include "queue.h"
    ```

4. Build your program with the copied source files.

    ```bash
    gcc program.c queue.c
    ```

### Example

The [example](./example/) and [test](./test/) directories contain practical usage demonstrations:

- `examples/` ‚Üí Basic usage samples
- `test/` ‚Üí Advanced test cases
